I designed a 5 DOF robot arm using Autodesk inventor 

## Robot arm base 

I started by designing the robot arm base

## Gripper 

Finally, i designed a basic gripper which is going to be editable in the future

## Robot arm final assembly 

In the last step i did the assembly part and to explain why it is a 5 DOF, there will be a motor in the bottom of the base, a motor between the base and the first arm, a motor between the first and second arm, a motor between the second and the third arm and finally a motor between the third and the gripper
